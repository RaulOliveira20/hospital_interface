# hospital_interface

This is a project of a hospital interface with made-up data.

The main page is only able to access and view data, while the staff and admin pages possess more buttons where they can also modify and add/delete information.

The test.php file is where the connection to the database is made and where data is retrieved and displayed.

Anyone can access the main page, since it requires no login of any sort. All of the buttons are searches only and it looks like this:

Each of the buttons show different data stored in the database.
